# Achron-EX
Achron, EX mod, Distribution files

Instructions for installing the Achron, EX mod:
1. Make or install a fresh copy of un-modified Achron v1.7.0.0. (Achron EX will make some parts of the Achron unplayable: in particular the campaign. So it is best to make a dedicated copy of the game just for the mod.)
2. Find the main directory for your new copy of Achron.
3. (Optional) Rename the directory as Achron_EX (or whatever name you want).
4. (Optional) If you got your copy of the game from Steam and you are using Windows, consider replacing Achron.exe with the Achron.exe file from this repository. This will let you play the mod without having to log into Steam.
5. Download and unzip the Achron_EX.zip file from this repository into the Achron_EX top directory.
6. (Optional) Download and unzip the EX_Models.zip file from this repository into the Achron_EX top directory. This will replace some of the unit models with updated versions that better reflect their new roles, but it is not required.
7. Open Achron.exe to play the game. (Remember to set up any firewall permissions just like any orther new installation of Achron.)


Tips for playing Achron, EX mod:
1. Remember that the project is not finished yet, and a lot of features are still missing and the balance is a work in progress.
2. Play the EX Skirmish and Sandbox maps, as these will give you a better sense of the mod than any of the vanilla maps or the campaign (which probably won't even run).
3. Note that if you select Player 1 on a Skirmish map, you will be able to select your opponents’ species from their species selectors after the game begins, not just your own. 
4. If in doubt about how a unit works, look at its unit tooltip, and its command bar tooltips--especially Move and Attack. The information in these field is usually (though not always) pretty accurate.
5. If you have questions don’t hesitate to post in the Achron forum. That might also be a good place to request multiplayer games.


What’s new in Achron, EX:
** General:
* Currently only Grekim and CESO are playable.
* Combat takes place on a smaller, more tactical scale with rarely more than a dozen units per side in any battle, although there may be multiple battles in different locations going on at once.
* Fog of War is much less important, as many units and buildings are visible in FoW. This makes scouting less vital.
* The mod works best on small maps with plentiful alternate paths and choke points.

** Economy:
* QP is the only primary resource. It is mined from both red crates and blue crates; the former being efficient but exhaustible, and the latter being inexhaustible but rare and costly to prepare for mining.
* LC is a secondary resource produced only by CESO as a bi-product of mining QP and other activities. Grekim and CESO also use Power as a passive resource to regulate mining and other special abilities.
* Grekim and CESO both place great emphasis on aggressive expansion and map control to maintain a strong economy.

** Combat:
* Most units and buildings leave behind wreckage when killed that temporarily blocks pathing and can damage nearby units.
* A lot of units also have very powerful splash damage attacks, or other combat abilities that make them very hard counters to their preferred opponents.
* Most units feature a fatigue mechanic, which greatly reduces their combat effectiveness in some way if they engage in prolonged combat or long distance movement.
* The mod therefore highly rewards proactive positioning and retroactive micro-management of individual units in response to future events, in order to retain valuable combat assets.

** Other:
* Grekim and CESO both start Skirmish matches with one or more Achron units that perform some vital functions for them--such as healing, generating resources, and building Subspace Amplifiers. (These features are currently very incomplete.)
* Achrons can’t be killed, but they can be temporarily incapacitated, which is something you should try to avoid. (Again. this feature is currently very incomplete.)
* The only objective of any Skirmish match is to build or capture 12 Subspace Amplifiers (work in progress, but you can pretend). You can stop an opponent who is close by sacrificing one of your own Amplifiers to blow up one of theirs.
* Amplifiers can also be sacrificed to Freeze an important enemy unit anywhere on the map. **Though easily overlooked, this is an extremely important counter against certain rushes and heavy units.**
